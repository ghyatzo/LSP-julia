Version 1.2.0 (2022-06-22)
--------------------------

  * Added a new command "LSP-julia: Open Julia REPL in Tab" in the command palette to use
    a normal tab instead of the bottom panel for the REPL (requires the Terminus package).

  * The default value for the "julia.completionmode" setting changed from "import" to "qualify".
    (All settings use the default values from VS Code).
    With the value "qualified", selection of an unexported variable from another module in the
    autocompletion popup will complete to a qualified variable name, instead of the automatic
    insertion of an explicit `using` statement.

  * Updated the language server to the latest version.
