Version 1.1.0 (2021-12-12)
--------------------------

  * The language server will be updated to the latest version when you open a
    Julia file the next time. There was a bug which prevented the installation
    of the language server to work before, but it should be fixed now. If the
    automatic update doesn't work, or the language server can't start, please
    open an issue at GitHub: https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-julia/issues

  * The language server now uses the JuliaFormatter.jl package for formatting
    ("LSP: Format File" & "LSP: Format Selection" commands). The former settings
    to configure formatting have been removed and formatting options must be
    configured via a .JuliaFormatter.toml file now. For documentation see
