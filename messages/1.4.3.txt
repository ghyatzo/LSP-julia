Version 1.4.3 (2024-01-09)
--------------------------

  * The "show_environment_status" setting was removed. The active Julia project
    which is indexed by the language server is always displayed in the status bar
    now, unless the global LSP setting "show_view_status" is disabled.

  * Updated the language server to the latest version.
